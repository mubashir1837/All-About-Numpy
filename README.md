# NumPy Vector Practice

This repository contains practice code and tutorials for creating and manipulating vectors using NumPy in Python. It's designed for beginners in machine learning and data science who want to get hands-on experience with NumPy arrays.

## Overview

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. This repo focuses on vectors, which are 1D arrays, and demonstrates various ways to create them using NumPy functions.

## Files

- `creating_a_vector.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with an introduction to NumPy and step-by-step examples of creating vectors.
- `practice_vector.py`: A Python script with practice code for creating different types of vectors.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the .ipynb file)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mubashir1837/All-About-Numpy.git
   cd numpy-vector-practice
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `creating_a_vector.ipynb` and run the cells to follow the tutorial.

### Running the Python Script

Execute the practice script directly:
```bash
python practice_vector.py
```

This will print various examples of vector creation to the console.

## Examples Covered

The code demonstrates creating vectors using:

- `np.array()`: From a list
- `np.arange()`: From a range
- `np.random.rand()`: Random values
- `np.linspace()`: Equally spaced values
- `np.full()`: Filled with a constant value
- `np.concatenate()`: Combining arrays
- `np.zeros()` and `np.ones()`: Arrays of zeros and ones
